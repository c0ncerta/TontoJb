P2JB (Patience to Jailbreak)

Bug was patched at PS5 13.00
Exploitable code is only present at PS5 as PS4 kqueue does not hold ucred

In sys_kqueueex syscall, crhold() is called on ucred to store a credential
reference in the kqueue struct. If the optional name argument is non-NULL and
copyinstr() fails, the error cleanup path calls free(), fdclose(), and fdrop() —
but never crfree() — leaving the ucred reference count permanently incremented.

Exploitation:

// Any non-NULL pointer causing copyinstr to fail
__sys_kqueueex((const char *)0x800000000000ULL);  // EFAULT, leaks 1 ref

Repeatedly call sys_kqueueex with an invalid name pointer, leaking one cr_ref
per call. The 32-bit counter approaches 0xFFFFFFFF in few hours, reducible with
multiple threads. Before cr_ref reaches 0, open several files. Each falloc calls
crhold(td->td_ucred) for fp->f_cred, bumping cr_ref by 1 per file. This gives
the attacker controlled references to the ucred object. When cr_ref reaches 1,
call setuid(). This causes the kernel to allocate a new ucred buffer, copy the
existing credentials into it, and call crfree() on the old ucred — decrementing
cr_ref to 0 and freeing the old ucred object, while the previously opened files
still hold fp->f_cred pointers into the now-freed memory. Spray the heap with
attacker-controlled data with cr_ref = 1. This reclaims the freed ucred memory.
Close one of the previously opened file. fdrop calls crfree(fp->f_cred) on the
fake ucred, decrementing the attacker-controlled cr_ref. Doing this repeatedly
will result double, triple frees to f_cred which will lead to arbitrary kernel
read write.

Below is PoC
